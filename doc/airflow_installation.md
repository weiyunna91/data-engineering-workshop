# Apache Airflow Installation Steps

## Initialize the Airflow Database
Airflow uses a database to store metadata. Initialize it with:

```bash
airflow db init
```

## Create an Admin User
Set up an administrative user to access the Airflow web interface:

```bash
airflow users create \    
    --username admin \    
    --firstname Admin \    
    --lastname User \    
    --role Admin \    
    --email admin@example.com
```

## Start the Airflow Services
Launch the Airflow scheduler and webserver in separate terminal sessions.

### Start the Scheduler:

```bash
airflow scheduler
```

### Start the Webserver:

```bash
airflow webserver --port 8080
```

Access the Airflow web interface at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and log in with the credentials you set up.

## Install Additional Dependencies (Optional)
If your workflows require additional Python packages, install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn networkx scikit-learn
```

By following these steps, you'll have Apache Airflow installed and configured, ready to develop and manage your workflows.
